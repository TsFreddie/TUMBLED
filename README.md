# Tumbled Bitmap Font 圆石点阵黑

## Design Principle

- Designed to be used in PebbleOS or other embedded devices
- Automatic bold weight convertion

## Bold Conversion

Bold font is generated by copying the glyph 1px to the right

## Codepoints Coverage

> PebbleOS currently works directly with codepoints with no concept of graphemes / glyphs.

For CJK codepoints specifically, this font target specific standard documents. These documents are compiled into a gaint codepoint list and use the following steps to determine which to include:

- Read [pages](./pages) directory for all the de-duplicated codepoints
- Remove all codepoints exceeds 16 bits
- Read [extra](./pages/extra) directory for additional codepoints
- Reference the [FREQUENCY](./data/FREQUENCY) file and cut the extra character until we reached total 9000 character
- Read [misc](./pages/misc) directory and add them to the final set

The current hard cap PebbleOS can hold in a single PBF file is 10922 16-bit codepoints.
We set our limit to 9000 to both reduce the design work and leave extra spaces for missing characters in other languages.
